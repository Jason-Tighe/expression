VibeChecking in Action:

#Purpose of this WebApp: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a platform where a person can share their thoughts and stuggles without judgement. I and many others have had times where you want to vent some issue or problem, or celebrate small victories. However, maybe you don't have anyone to send it too, or don't think it's something worth sharing. Bottling something up is bad for your health, so the idea is have a space to let things go. 

Second purpose is to connect people, to show how people are going through similar issues and that in the end we're not all that different. 


#Inspiration:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Inspiration came from the idea of when you have an issue with someone you should write a letter expressing how you feel, but you never send the letter. A cathartic way to let things go. Additionally, the idea of sharing your dreams, no matter how wild  or weird, are almost never interesting to the people you tell them too, so why not share it in a space where someone might appreciate them.

#After reading the Study Materials from React and Looking at challenges you experienced in your Unit-3 project what questions do you have about the MERN Stack, what improvements can you make to your project? 

#Questions:
* Mostly wondering about media and video intergration with React. I feel like it's something we never went over. I know most places just link their video that's also on youtube, but I'd be interested in going over different type of media players, use cases, best practices for intergration, and whatever else I may be missing. 

* How would some of our features, that we've incorporated into our projects, look in Angular or Vue? Is there a difference? 

* How would we "convert" it to ReactNative? Does the MERN stack change in any significant way?



#Improvements to make:

* Number one thing I'm aware that can easily be improved. Breaking things down into components.  A lot of my code when it came to what was presented was redundent because of conditionals, so a componet would have made reading the code and naviagting easier. Additionally, some of my conditionals are for changing a class property to another. This is seen when you click the button to bring up the form, the button goes from a [+] to a [-]. Now that I'm aware that you can make class names conditional, as well as other styling, it think it'd be a great thing to look further into and add to clean up redundent code. 

* A big thing I'd REALLY like to look at it ReactNative. I believe this webApp would be a great tool on the go, and if I could learn more about ReactNative I could port it over.
